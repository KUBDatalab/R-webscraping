This is not an introduction to R. We are assuming that you have a working 
relationship with R, and are familiar with the following concepts.

LISTE

If you do not know these concepts, you will probably not have a great experience
following this course, and it is recommended that you follow one of our 
introductory courses

or gain familiarity with R in another way.


Scraping the web, otherwise known as harvesting data, is an important tool for
gathering data on a multitude of subjects. 

Articles from newspapers
Press announcements from organisations - including those on page 2 of the website
Current weather
Grapping a current image of St. Peters Basilica for live estimations of visitornumbers.

Anyway, there is something on the web. We would like to get a copy of it.

And rather than going to the website manually and copy paste the date we want,
it would be preferable to get the computer to do it for us.

How do we do that?

First of all we need to know just a little bit about the structure of webpages.
